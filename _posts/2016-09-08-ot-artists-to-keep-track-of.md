### Purpose

This is a list for myself that contains music that I've stumbled upon recently and that I don't want to forget again straight away. I will keep adding to this as new stuff trickles in. Song names are in normal font, album names/collections of songs are *italicized*. 

Please feel free to let me know about your own finds, too! 


### The List

- [Cyrille Aimée - Make You Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqw-f74eXk8) -- It is amazing what some people do with loop pedals!
- [The Breeders - Head to Toe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Huozu5FZH4) -- I will never grow tired of this bored voice. Two more examples: ['Hag'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCvQULLydwc) and ['No Aloha'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9hAS2uHG_I), both from their 1993 album *Last Splash*. 
- [Elliott Smith - *Lucky Three*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQf9zbbkdgk) -- Another one.
- [Elliott Smith - *Live at The Jon Brion Show*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK4okHerWeI) -- Elliott Smith at his best, supported by Jon Brion and Brad Mehldau, two great musicians. The setlist includes beautiful renditions of 'Son of Sam' and 'Happiness' plus a great John Lennon cover and a performance of Brion's song 'Trouble' with Smith on second guitar.
- [Justin Townes Earle - Halfway to Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sgCwMoN580) -- What an amazing guitarist and singer! (This is a rediscovery. I first saw a [video of his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9W511HVxuY) on Grooveshark in late 2011 when there was still competition in the world of music streaming platforms, but then somehow forget about him again. Just like people forgot about Grooveshark.)
- [37500 Yens - *Astero*](https://37500yens.bandcamp.com/) -- This was posted to a math rock board a couple of hours ago.  
- [Pictochat - Leaving (ft. Miel Bredouw)](https://soundcloud.com/donovan-kouanchao/pictochat-leaving-ft-miel-bredouw) -- Thanks to J.F. (If you're into this kind of music, you should also check out [stevo](https://soundcloud.com/stevo/02-afternoon), [altitude.](https://soundcloud.com/altitvde/c-h-e-r-r-y), and [a.bee](https://soundcloud.com/mdnghtcltr/abee-shades)!)
- [Public Transport - Morgenrot](https://soundcloud.com/public-transport/morgenrot) -- Gaze :)  
- [Weval - Out of the Game](https://soundcloud.com/atomnation/weval-01-out-of-the-game) -- Beautiful (played at Fusion last year). 
- [Little Barrie - Why Don't You Do It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLAWTIKcV4s) -- Found this on an old sampler from Munich. What a guitar sound.
- [Emma Ruth Rundle - Protection](http://www.stereogum.com/1896176/emma-ruth-rundle-protection/franchises/premiere/) -- Currently on tour. Playing @ Heimathafen on 09/23!
- [Bradon Can't Dance - *LXVE EP*](https://luckynumber.bandcamp.com/album/lxve-ep) -- Nice when the sun's out and you don't have anything to do.
- [Porridge Radio - Rice, Pasta and Other Fillers](https://porridgeradio.bandcamp.com/album/rice-pasta-and-other-fillers) -- Band from Brighton, UK :) This is their first full-length album after a lot of solo home recordings from their singer Dana.
- [Margaret Glaspy - *Emotions and Math*](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/listen-to-margaret-glaspys-emotions-math) -- Beautiful debut (!) album, used to be available for streaming in its entirety in the link provided. Unfortunately, now you only get 30-second snippets. I hear she's on Spotify, though.
- [FFX - Catch Up](https://ffxdtf.bandcamp.com/) -- Duo, originally from Ljubljana, Slovenia. Now working from Berlin.
- [Goblin \*\*\*\* - World is Moving](http://www.metalinjection.net/av/heres-an-album-stream-from-a-band-called-goblin-cock) -- Came across them because Nick Reinhard (from the great [Tera Melos](https://teramelos.bandcamp.com/)) is helping out on guitar for their upcoming US tour.
- [Oxbow - *The Narcotic Story*](https://oxbow.bandcamp.com/album/the-narcotic-story) -- Incredibly well-arranged album, co-produced by Joe Chiccarelli (Frank Zappa), singer reminds me a lot of the early [Enik](http://enik.net/). 
- [Molly Drake - I Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52eMBSRNYxA) -- Nick Drake's mother, an amazing singer and lyricist. I really wonder why I've only just found her.
- [Mr. Bungle - *California*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITEDFYdLHFA) -- A recent rediscovery. Surely takes some time to get used to, but Mike Patton might very well be one of the most interesting artists around. In this album, he shows off an overwhelming amount of his skills.
- [Horace Bray - *Dream State*](https://horacebray.bandcamp.com/album/dreamstate) -- Great modern jazz guitarist from Texas. Start with '3 4 5' (3 over 4 over 5, as the name suggests).
