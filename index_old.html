<p>I am a <span itemprop="title">master student</span> of <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/" target="_blank" itemprop="affiliation">Social Sciences (M.A.)</a> at Humboldt University of Berlin. From 2015 to 2016, I was a Global Visiting Scholar in the <a href="http://sociology.as.nyu.edu/page/masters" target="_blank" itemprop="affiliation">Applied Quantitative Research (M.A.)</a> programme at New York University.</p> 

<!-- 
In 2012, and a Visiting Student at the <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/" target="_blank" itemprop="affiliation"> University of Sussex</a> (2012).
-->

<p>My main research interest lies in the intersection between data science, statistics, and the social sciences. I have broad experience in the collection, processing, visualisation, and analysis of statistical data. I have also provided assistance in weighting and missing data problems (especially multiple imputation) to two public research institutes. In my master thesis, I analyse political communciation behaviour on a large social media site using modern machine learning tools.</p>

<p>My preferred statistical programming languages are R, Python, and Stata. I also like creating <a href="/ImmiMaps/" target="_blank">interactive visualizations and maps</a> using <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p>In a addition to multiple years of being a freelance statistician, I have worked as a research assistant at the <a href="http://www.diw.de/en/" target="_blank">German Institute for Economic Research (DIW)</a>, the <a href="https://www.dza.de/en" target="_blank">German Centre of Gerontology</a>, and in various student assistant positions (both teaching and research) at the <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en" target="_blank">Department of Social Sciences</a> at Humboldt University of Berlin. I have also been a research assistant to <span itemprop="contact">Prof. Spencer Henson</span> at the <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk" target="_blank">Institute of Development Studies</a> in Brighton, UK and to <span itemprop="contact">Prof. Ellen Immergut</span> in the Norface project <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comppol-en/research/ongoing-research-projects-1/copy_of_healthdox" target="_blank">"HEALTHDOX - The Paradox of Health Care Futures"</a> (funded by the German National Science Foundation).</p>
