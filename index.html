<p>I am a master student of <a href= "https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en" target="_blank">Social Sciences (M.A.)</a> at <a href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/en" target="_blank">Humboldt University of Berlin</a>, but am currently studying in the <a href="http://sociology.as.nyu.edu/page/masters" target="_blank">Applied Quantitative Research (M.A.)</a> program at <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a>. I am a research assistant to Ellen Immergut in the Norface project <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comppol-en/research/ongoing-research-projects-1/copy_of_healthdox" target="_blank">"HEALTHDOX - The Paradox of Health Care Futures"</a> (funded by the German National Science Foundation).</p>

<p>In the past, I have worked as a research assistant at the <a href="http://www.diw.de/en/" target="_blank">German Institute for Economic Research (DIW)</a>, the <a href="https://www.dza.de/en" target="_blank">German Centre of Gerontology</a>, and in various student assistant positions (both teaching and research) at the <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en" target="_blank">Department of Social Sciences</a> at Humboldt University of Berlin. I have also been a research assistant to <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/spencer-henson" target="_blank">Spencer Henson</a> at the <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk" target="_blank">Institute of Development Studies</a> in Brighton, UK.</p> 

<p>My main research interest is in modern quantitative social science. I have applied text analysis tools to analyze parliamentary debates, newspapers, and online user-generated content. I have also provided assistance in weighting and missing data problems (especially multiple imputation) to two public research institutes.</p> 

<p>My preferred statistical programming languages are <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>, <a href="http://www.stata.com/" target="_blank">Stata</a>, and <a href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>. In my free time, I like creating <a href="http://thomashe89.github.io/gisI-final/" target="_blank">interactive visualizations and maps</a> using <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>.</p>
