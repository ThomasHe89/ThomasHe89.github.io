<p>I am a <span itemprop="title">master student</span> of <a href= "https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en" target="_blank">Social Sciences (M.A.)</a> at <a href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/en" target="_blank" itemprop="affiliation">Humboldt University of Berlin</a>. I also was a Global Visiting Scholar in the <a href="http://sociology.as.nyu.edu/page/masters" target="_blank">Applied Quantitative Research (M.A.)</a> program at <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank" itemprop="affiliation">New York University</a> (2015-2016) and a Visiting Student at the University of Sussex (2012).</p>

<p>I have worked as a research assistant at the <a href="http://www.diw.de/en/" target="_blank">German Institute for Economic Research (DIW)</a>, the <a href="https://www.dza.de/en" target="_blank">German Centre of Gerontology</a>, and in various student assistant positions (both teaching and research) at the <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en" target="_blank">Department of Social Sciences</a> at Humboldt University of Berlin. I have also been a research assistant to <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/spencer-henson" target="_blank" itemprop="contact">Spencer Henson</a> at the <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk" target="_blank">Institute of Development Studies</a> in Brighton, UK and to <span itemprop="contact">Ellen Immergut</span> in the Norface project <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comppol-en/research/ongoing-research-projects-1/copy_of_healthdox" target="_blank">"HEALTHDOX - The Paradox of Health Care Futures"</a> (funded by the German National Science Foundation).</p>

<p>My main research interest lies in the intersection between data science, statistics, and the social sciences. I have broad experience in the collection, processing, visualisation, and analysis of survey data. In addition, I have provided assistance in weighting and missing data problems (especially multiple imputation) to two public research institutes. In my master thesis, I analyze political communciation behaviour on a large social media site using modern machine learning tools. </p> 

<p>My preferred statistical programming languages are <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>, <a href="http://www.stata.com/" target="_blank">Stata</a>, and <a href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>. I also like creating <a href="/ImmiMaps/" target="_blank">interactive visualizations and maps</a> using <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>.</p>
