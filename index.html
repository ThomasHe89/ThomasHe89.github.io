<p>I am a data scientist with broad experience in the collection, processing, visualisation and analysis of statistical data. Simply put: my passion is to discover knowledge from data. I am convinced that the potential of today's important data sources is far from fully leveraged. Hence, I focus on novel data forms (process- and user-generated data), modern retrieval techniques (web scraping, APIs), and cutting-edge analysis methods (machine learning, NLP).</p>

<!--
<p>My preferred programming languages are R, Python, and Stata. I also use Javascript to create <a href="/ImmiMaps/" target="_blank">interactive online visualizations</a>.</p>

<p>I have completed a <span itemprop="title">Master's degree</span> in <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/" target="_blank" itemprop="affiliation">Social Sciences (M.A.)</a> at Humboldt University of Berlin. From 2015 to 2016, I was a Global Visiting Scholar in the <a href="http://sociology.as.nyu.edu/page/masters" target="_blank" itemprop="affiliation">Applied Quantitative Research (M.A.)</a> programme at New York University. In my master thesis, I analysed political communciation behaviour using an algorithm for the automated topical classification of Facebook posts.</p>

<p>In a addition to multiple years of being a freelance statistician (design and analysis of clinical trials, missing data), I have worked as a research assistant at the <a href="http://www.diw.de/en/" target="_blank">German Institute for Economic Research (DIW)</a>, the <a href="https://www.dza.de/en" target="_blank">German Centre of Gerontology</a>, and in various student assistant positions (both teaching and research) at the <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en" target="_blank">Department of Social Sciences</a> at Humboldt University of Berlin. I have also been a research assistant to <span itemprop="contact">Prof. Ellen Immergut</span> in the Norface project <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comppol-en/research/ongoing-research-projects-1/copy_of_healthdox" target="_blank">"HEALTHDOX - The Paradox of Health Care Futures"</a> (funded by the German National Science Foundation) and to <span itemprop="contact">Prof. Spencer Henson</span> at the <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk" target="_blank">Institute of Development Studies</a> in London, UK.</p>
