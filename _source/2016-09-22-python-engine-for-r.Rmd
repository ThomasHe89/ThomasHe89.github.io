R is making progress when it comes to improving the interoperability between Python and R. Note that what you are looking at here is a .Rmd file. Using ```` ```{python} ```` instead of ```` ```{R} ```` activates the Python engine. This means that R evaluates Pythong commands now.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{python}
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

```{python}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x.split(' '))
```

PS: Wes McKinney and Hadley Wickham even seem to be working on a common data format called *Feather*. More on this exciting new development can be found [here](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/03/29/feather/).
